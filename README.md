   cd ../backend
   pip install django
   pip install djangorestframework
   pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt
   pip install django-cors-headers

   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   "venv\Scripts\activate"  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply migrations:
   ```bash

5. Create a superuser for admin access:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Configuration
- **CORS**: The app is configured to allow requests from the frontend domain (`http://localhost:5173`). Adjust `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `settings.py` if needed.
- **Environment Variables**: Modify the `.env` file for environment-specific settings.

## ‚ö° Real-Time Collaboration
- Real-time collaboration is powered by Django Channels. Ensure that your setup includes a Redis server or use a hosted alternative like **Upstash**.

To install and run Redis locally:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis
redis-server
```

Update the `CHANNEL_LAYERS` setting in `settings.py` for the Redis connection.
